# CoreArena
CoreArena is a premium quality Bukkit bukkit that brings a whole new experience to your Minecraft server in the form of a monster fight arena. Its unique approach is determined by

* a realistic physical engine allowing you to fully destroy arenas (differently) each time you play.
* class upgrades and reward system based on a currency players receive while playing in the arena and that is stored outside the arena.
* cleanly designed menus and powerful user interface in-game.
* unique monster spawner options (each is clickable).
* 5 minutes setup with point-visualization and user interactivity in-game without the need of accessing files.
* full automatization, no admin required on the server.
